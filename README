==== What's this ? ====
This is an Akonadi resource for Tomboy-compatible note servers like Grauphel.

==== Usage ====
For this resource you need only the URL of your service,
e.g. https://fqdn/index.php/apps/grauphel
It is the same URL that you have used in Tomboy.
For the registration process it will open a web page where you can log in
with your username and password of your account of the note server.

==== Tested with ====
Today it's tested only with Grauphel. So it may be incompatible with
other server implemantations (e.g. Rainy). But you are free to test it
and to report your experiences.
